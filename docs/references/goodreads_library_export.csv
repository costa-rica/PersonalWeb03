In some chapters, I began to connect with the characters and settle into the narrative, the chapter would end and move on to, what seemed to me, entirely new cast and situation. I kept waiting for a clear through line, but never found one.<br/><br/>There were songs and letters whose connections to other chapters or to a larger story weren’t clear to me. An early chapter involving a slave “hunter” made me think the novel might focus on slavery, but that thread didn’t continue. Another chapter about two sisters running an apple farm—tragic, lively, and lightly haunted—was especially compelling, and I wished that story had been allowed to evolve.<br/><br/>I pushed on, hoping everything would eventually click.

In that moment I was at a point of a complicated frustration with everyone from Sam (for making steps forward with EA the undoing it all and with his lack of organization and perhaps lack of I don’t know what…) to the frustration with his colleagues… and the lawyers (John Ray). <br/><br/>Before I make this next comparison I would like to add I just did some brief research and it seems over $7 billion has already been recovered from the FTX liquidation.<br/><br/>What a mess. It absolutely reminds me of Malcom Gladwell’s chapter on Amanda Knox. Knox was a woman wrongfully convicted of murder.<br/><br/>Crypto is new, unfamiliar and its value to most of the world seems to be viewed as another gambling game for affluent societies. It has not yet traversed into a stable currency for lesser developed countries, economists have hoped it will.<br/><br/>SBF is a pod (Seinfeld reference). The convergence of the two with all that money made for a perfect storm.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this storm will set crypto and effective altruism back.<br/><br/>What a story. Honestly I did not rate this 5 stars because it was an easy read. It was not. But I can’t imagine how frustrating it was for the author to try to make sense of this mess. Furthermore, how to organize a narrative with all the disparate pieces they must have witnessed. Thank you for putting in the time.<br/><br/>",true,,1,0

And for the latter, I wonder the difficulty and second guessing Harari might have went through to put into words.<br/><br/>I want to thank Harari for Deus after Sapiens. It’s refreshing and a gift to us to have someone that is clearly knowledgeable of human history to observe what is quickly happening in front of us, and try to makes sense it.<br/><br/>I sense Harari holds a fairly neutral perspective of past and future.
